### Introduction

Text elements are foundational pieces of content used in a webpage. HTML supports many ways to format text, so it may feel like you're writing a tedious Word document at first. Just remember, this was what a webpage was initially for, sharing documents.

#### Skills to Practice

- Creating a web page
- Creating HTML *Text* elements
    - Paragraph - `<p></p>`
    - Heading - `<h1></h1> ... <h6></h6>`
    - Bold and Italic - `<b></b> and <i></i>`
    - Horizontal rule and line break - `<hr> and <br>`
- Opening a web page for testing

Horizontal rule and line break are not actually text elements, but they're important elements to know in the beginning. A horizontal rule is just a line that seperates content. A line break is used to create extra *whitespace* between content. You may notice that making extra space between HTML elements doesn't actually space out the elements. The browser *collapses* extra space in between elements by default. These elements are also examples of elements that are *self-closing*. They **don't** need closing tags. You may also see them written in this format: `<hr /> <br />`. It makes no difference, write them however you like.

### Activity Instructions

#### Setup
1. Create a new repl.
    1. Select *HTML, CSS, JS* for the language.
    2. Name the Repl "*1.2 Text Elements*".
2. Click Create repl.
3. The *index.html* page has starting markup that we don't need. Erase *lines 7 and 10*.

#### Instructions

In web design, it's common to see placeholder text that looks like fake Latin. This is called *lorem ipsum* text, and it's very popular when demoing a webpage or app text. In Repl, you can type the word **lorem**, followed by the **tab key**. You will see lorem ipsum text in this and many other activities. Don't bother writing it out by hand, let your editor generate it for you.

1. Change the text inside the title element so it says "*HTML Text Elements*".
2. Create your webpage content using the reference below. Remember, all of the content on the page goes inside the `<body></body>` element.


```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>HTML Text Elements</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My Text Website</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
