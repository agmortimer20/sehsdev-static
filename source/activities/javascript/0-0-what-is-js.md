[‚Üê Back](/activities/javascript/)

### Introduction

JavaScript is the programming language of the web. Every single has a version JavaScript built in to it. Therefore, every single computer with a web browser can execute JavaScript! Though originally made for the web, JavaScript can be used to build desktop apps, mobile apps, video games, and more.

There are essentially two ways to write JavaScript and run apps: there are browser based versions of JavaScript, and there is a JavaScript platform called **Node.js**, or Node for short. Node.js is a platform that allows you to run JavaScript applications *outside* of a web browser.

The most popular desktop, mobile, and web apps are built with JavaScript:

* Netflix
* Hulu
* Facebook
* AirBnB
* Instagram
* Uber Eats
* Discord
* Slack
* Twitch
* WhatsApp
* Many, many more

### Sample Exercise

Try this out: open up Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox. Hit the *F12* key on your keyboard to open up the developer tools. Find the tab labeled **console**. The developer console allows you to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.

Type the following line into the console and press *enter*:

```js
alert("Hello!")
```
