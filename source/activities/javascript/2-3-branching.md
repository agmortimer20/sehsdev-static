### Introduction

The last activity introduced us to the idea of controlling the flow of an application with *if statements*. The age checker app checked each if statement's condition resulted in true. There are many instances where you only want one selection to execute. i.e. One or the other.

We can *branch* if statements with to other kinds of statements, `else if` and `else`.
* `else if` must follow and if statement, and will only check it's condition if the preceding if statement condition resulted in `false`. You can chain as many else if statements as you want, but they *must* come after the initial if statement.
* `else` must be at the end of an if or else if statement. It does not require a condition, and will execute if any preceding if or else if statement coniditions result in `false`.

*Example:*
```js
var number = 100

if (number > 100) {
    console.log("number is higher than 100")
}
else if (number == 100) {
    console.log("number is 100")
}
else {
    console.log("number is less than 100")
}
```

#### Skills to Practice

- Branching if statements with *else if* and *else*
- Making a main menu

### Activity Instructions

#### Setup

1. Create a new repl.
    1. Select *Node.js* for the language.
    2. Name the Repl "*2.3 Branching*".
2. Click Create repl.

#### Code
```js
var readline = require("readline-sync")

// Legal Driving Age Checker
// Try and see how this application is different from the last one.
var age = readline.question("Enter your age: ")
age = parseInt(age)

if (age >= 16) {
    console.log("You are old enough to drive!")
}
else if (age == 15) {
    console.log("You can't drive on your own yet, but you are eligible for a learners permit.")
}
else {
    console.log("I'm sorry, but you are not old enough to drive")
}


// Simple ATM Demo
console.log("\n--- ATM Demo ---\n")
var balance = parseFloat(readline.question("Set your initial balance: $"))

console.log("Crangis McBasketball ATM")
console.log("------------------------")
console.log("Select an option: ")
console.log("1) View Balance")
console.log("2) Deposit")
console.log("3) Withdraw")

// We're not doing math with the number, so it's okay to leave it as a string.
var option = readline.question("Enter your option (1,2,3): ")

if (option == "1") {
    console.log(`Your balance is $${balance}.`)
}
else if (option == "2") {
    var deposit = readline.question("How much would you like to deposit? $")
    deposit = parseFloat(deposit)
    balance = balance + deposit
    console.log(`Thank you for your deposit of $${deposit}.`)
    console.log(`Your balance is now $${balance}.`)
}
else if (option == "3") {
    var withdraw = readline.question("How much would you like to withdraw? $")
    withdraw = parseFloat(withdraw)
    balance = balance - withdraw
    console.log(`Thank you for your withdraw of $${withdraw}.`)
    console.log(`Your balance is now $${balance}.`)
}
else {
    console.log("Invalid option. Exiting...")
}

```

#### Debug

```shell
Enter your age: 16
Enter your age: 16
You are old enough to drive!

--- ATM Demo ---

Set your initial balance: $1200
Crangis McBasketball ATM
------------------------
Select an option: 
1) View Balance
2) Deposit
3) Withdraw
Enter your option (1,2,3): 2
How much would you like to deposit? $75.95
Thank you for your deposit of $75.95.
Your balance is now $1275.95.
```

### Tips, Tricks, and Reflection

- Notice how many code blocks are used to create even a simple application. Be careful with the following formatting (You will thank me later):
    - Make sure all curly braces line up nicely.
    - Make sure code inside a code block is indented one tab.

- Each demo applicatio only has one `else if` statement. Remember, you can have as many `else if` statements as you need.
