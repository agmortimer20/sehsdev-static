### Introduction

The Magic 8-Ball is a fortune-telling toy. You ask the 8-ball a question, shake it up, and a response is shown in a little window. Some example responses include:

* It is certain.
* Without a doubt.
* Ask again later.
* Cannot predict now.
* Don't count on it.
* Outlook not so good.

#### Skills to Practice
- Writing if statements
- Generating random numbers

### Challenge Tasks
1. Open your code editor and create a new program title "*Magic 8-Ball*".
2. Complete the folowing tasks:
    1. Prompt the user to enter a question. You don't need to save the question, because we don't actually use their question in any meaningful way. We're just giving the user hope.
    2. Generate a random number. This random number will match up to some response.
    3. Depending on the random number, output an answer from the examples above. Include them all in your program.
