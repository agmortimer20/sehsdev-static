### Introduction

Heads or tails is a simple game where someone flips a coin and hides how it landed. The top side of the coin is heads, and the bottom side of the coin is tails. The goal of the game is for the player to correctly guess which side of the coin landed on top.

#### Skills to Practice

##### Without Iteration
- Generating random numbers
- Writing if statements

##### With Iteration
- Repeating statements with loops

### Challenge Tasks
1. Open your code editor and create a new program title "*Heads or Tails Game*".
2. Create a game that randomly generates either "heads" or "tails".
3. Prompt the user to guess "heads" or "tails".
4. Tell them if they guessed correctly or incorrectly.

#### Using Iteration
5. Ask the user if they want to play again. If so, start a new game.
6. Track the wins and losses.
