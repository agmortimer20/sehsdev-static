### Introduction

This application is the second version of Code Challenge 9. The difference in this application is that your responses will be grouped into an array.

#### Skills to Practice
- Generating a random index

### Challenge Tasks
1. Open your code editor and create a new program title "*Magic 8-Ball*".
2. Complete the folowing tasks:
    1. Prompt the user to enter a question. You don't need to save the question, because we don't actually use their question in any meaningful way. We're just giving the user hope.
    2. Generate a random number that corresponds to a random index.
    3. Output the response at the index of the random number.
    4. Create **12** response elements in the array. You can use the six from the previous application, and create six more of your own.
