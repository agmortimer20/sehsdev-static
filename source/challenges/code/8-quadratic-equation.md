### Introduction

The quadratic equation is a fundamental algebra formula for discovering roots of a parabola. This equation seems intimidating to calculate, but the key to it is to first calculate the *discriminant*, or *b squared - 4ac*. Depending on the result, you either need to use both formulas, just one of them, or neither of them.

#### Skills to Practice
- Invoke math functions
- Branching with selection statements

### Challenge Tasks
1. Open your code editor and create a new program title "*Quadratic Equation*".
2. Complete the folowing tasks:
    1. Prompt the user to enter the values for variables **a**, **b**, and **c**.
    2. Calculate the discriminant
    3. If the discriminant is greater than zero, there are **two roots**. Calculate both formulas.
    4. If the discriminant is equal to zero, there is **one root**. Use either formula.
    5. If the discriminant is negative, there are **no roots**. No need to calculate further.
    6. Output the result(s) to the user.
