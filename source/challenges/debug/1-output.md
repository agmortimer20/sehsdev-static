### Introduction

The first kinds of errors you are likely to come across are bugs in code that is trying to perform output. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

- Are all of your opening and closing strings and parentheses matched up?
- Are your identifiers written with the correct name?
- Did you use the right symbol when typing a statement?
- Does your syntax highlighting look a little funky?

#### Skills to Practice

- Read and interpret compiler errors
- Fix syntax errors


### Challenge Tasks
1. Open your code editor and create a new program title "*Debug Challenge 1 Output Errors*".
2. One at a time, read the syntax error when you run your program. Identify and fix the error.
3. In a seperate text file named *fixes.txt*, identify each issue and what you did to fix the error.

**Copy and paste** the following code into your file.

```js
console.log("Hey Buddy!")
console.log('My name is Anthony!')
console.log(How's it going???)

console,log("I saw a dog today.")
concole.log("Have you seen a dog? You probably haven't."
```

#### Sample Error Output
